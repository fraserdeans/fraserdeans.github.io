      <h1>Hello. I'm Fraser.</h1>
      <h2>
        Here’s 3 things to know about me. If you care to.
      </h2>
      <h3>Thing one. I’m co-founder at Nickelled.</h3>
      <p>With Nickelled, web companies build step-by-step tutorials that turn their inactive users into engaged customers. As a digital product designer, it’s a luxury and a pleasure to help great people solve their problems everyday.</p>
      <h3>Thing two. I’m homeless.</h3>
      <p>Well… not properly. Just in a sort of middle-class privileged kinda way.</p>
      
      <p>In my pursuit of a <strong><em>‘minimal lifestyle’</em></strong> I’ve turned my back on mortgages, long-term rental contracts and squashed my worldly possessions into a 22-litre backpack. Minimise to maximise.</p>
      <h3>Thing three. I’m a perpetual traveller.</h3>
      <p>Adopting a <strong><em>pure digital lifestyle</em></strong> means I don’t have to <strong><em>be anywhere</em></strong>… so why <strong><em>be anywhere in particular</em></strong>?</p>
      
      <p>Coffee shops, co-working spaces and the kitchen table become my office – enabling a life of long term travel.</p>
      
      <p>Over the last two years, I’ve made home (and friends) wherever I lay my hat: Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan.</p>
